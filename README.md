# 📈 Interactive Sales & Profit Dashboard (Excel)

## 📘 Project Overview

This project showcases a complete **Sales and Profit Dashboard** built entirely using **Microsoft Excel**. The primary goal was to create a highly efficient, interactive reporting tool for monitoring key business metrics and demonstrating foundational skills in data preparation, visualization, and automation.

## 🔑 Dashboard Structure & Key Metrics

The solution is built across three dedicated sheets to ensure data integrity and ease of use: **Data** (Cleaned Source Data), **Pivot Table** (Data Model Structure), and **Dashboard** (Final Visual Output).

### Key Metrics Visualized:

* Total Sales and Total Profit (KPIs).
* Profit Trend by Year.
* Sales Distribution by Product Category and State.
* Top 5 Customers by Profit.
* Monthly Sales Trends.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technical Skills Applied

This project helped solidify practical data analysis skills, including:

* **Data Preparation (Cleaning):** Structured and cleaned raw sales data into a ready-to-use table format.
* **Data Structure:** Utilization of **PivotTables** for efficient data summarization and establishing necessary relationships between fields.
* **User Interactivity:** Implementation of **Slicers and Timelines** for dynamic filtering by Year, Month, and Product Category.
* **Automation:** Integration of basic **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)** to create a functional **Refresh Button** for quick data updates.
